“VRS Admin” is a subsystem which is derived from, and used to manage “UKM VRS”. 
- User types:
    1.	Manager
    2.	Staff
        
Staff are able to perform the following functions:
- Block/Unblock users
- Assign and remove Ads
- Delete vehicles (For the purpose of keeping business records, removed vehicles by owners will be hidden completely from “UKM VRS”, but their records will remain in the database unless they are deleted by an admin)   
- Record receiving service fees
    
Managers on the other hand are able to perform everything that staff can do, as well as the following:
- Create accounts for new admins
- Assign “Staff” as “Managers” and vice versa
- Delete admin’s accounts

Other than enabling admins to perform some functions to manage “UKM VRS”, the system displays visualized data for the important records such as:
- Active vehicles
- Number of users
- Successful rents
- Total profit made
- The percentage of:
    1.	Available vehicles
    2.	Unavailable vehicles
    3.	Leased vehicles
    4.	Deleted “hidden” vehicles
        
In addition, it is designed to organize and display the important information in tables, these tables include:
- Users information
- Vehicles information
- Rental records
- Admins information
   
 “VRS Admin” was developed with one thing in mind, to make managing “UKM VRS” simple and efficient.
